## NestJS authentication with Passport, MongoDB, WebSocket and JWT

To use this server, get the [Angular Client](https://github.com/DenzelCode/nest-angular-auth-client) or [Flutter App](https://github.com/DenzelCode/flutter-auth) up and running.

You can also use this API using Postman or any other request framework.

Try it out now! [Demo](https://nest-auth.ubbly.club/)

It also contains a websocket implementation of the authentication too :D
